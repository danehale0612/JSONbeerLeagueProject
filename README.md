Phase one:

complete (except we don't have validation for the Add Team form)

Phase two:

The pre-defined schedule is complete (w/ by weeks included)

We can submit scores to display on the page.
The scores are local to the page, so when the page is refreshed the scores go away.

We still need to update wins and losses and have the Standings table update according to the percentage of w/l. (this now happens after entering scores and doing a page refresh 3/10/13)(completed)

Also added a "reset Season" button (3/10/13)



Master Code:

Dane Hale's git was the final copy of the code on github.com/danehale0612.
